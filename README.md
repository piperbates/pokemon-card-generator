# Pokemon-Card-Generator 2.0
Welcome to version two of my Pokemon Card Generator. This was my very first API project back when I was on the School of Code bootcamp, and I decided to rewrite it as part of an ongoing project to improve all of my personal projects.

The application makes use of PokeAPI.co to randomly generate a Pokemon card. You can also choose your own Pokemon by its dex number, and cycle through the Pokedex using the arrow keys.

You can start up the project locally by running `npm run dev`. Currently the `main` branch holds all of the original project, and will be eventually replaced by this `generator-v2` branch!

## Plan

* Keep the features of the original generator:
* * Get Pokemon by Dex number as well as random card
* * Show all the features it currently showcases (Name, dex number, HP, types, weight, height, moves, and ability)
* * Scroll to next Pokemon using arrows on either side of the card
* * Keep the design of the card the same, including having the background colour of the card be the same as the main type of the Pokemon
* Add function to search by Pokemon name as well as dex number
* Improve the overall feel of the site, make the page as a whole pretty rather than just the card

## History

The original version of this app was my first foray into API development and I learnt a significant amount about APIs during this project. This project was probably the moment I realised how much fun app development could be, I loved exploring the API and what it could provide. Revisiting this now, over two years since it was first developed, has a lot of sentimental value to me!

## How to use the Pokemon card generator.
* Navigate to the page using the link here: https://piperbates.github.io/pokemon-card-generator/
* Press "Get Random Card" to generate a random Pokemon from the Pokedex.
* Enter a Pokedex number (between 1-807) in the input field to get a specific Pokemon.
* Once you have a Pokemon card displayed, press the arrow keys to cycle through the Pokedex.
