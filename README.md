# Pokemon-Card-Generator 2.0
This is currently in the process of being refactored; for the more up to date code that hasn't been released yet, check out the `generator-v2` branch. This was originally my first ever project using an API, first built in week 2 of School of Code, now being rebuild to be a scalable, much more interesting React project using NextJS.

See the project live: https://piperbates.github.io/pokemon-card-generator/ (Currently showing the older, vanilla JS version)

Makes use of PokeAPI.co to randomly generate a Pokemon card. You can also choose your own Pokemon by its dex number, and cycle through the Pokedex using the arrow keys.

## How to use the Pokemon card generator.
Running it locally: `npm run dev`.

# Current goals
More scalable approach
Some testing
Validation in case the API is down or is updated in some way
